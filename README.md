# Day 28 - CSS Box Model  

## 📌 Topic  
Today’s practice was focused on understanding the **CSS Box Model** – one of the core concepts of CSS layout.  

The Box Model consists of:  
1. **Content** → The actual text or image inside the element.  
2. **Padding** → Space between content and border.  
3. **Border** → The edge surrounding the padding.  
4. **Margin** → Space outside the border that separates elements.

## 📝 What I Did  
- Created multiple **colored boxes** to visualize margin, padding, and border separately.  
- Experimented with:  
  - **Box 1 → Margin only**  
  - **Box 2 → Padding only**  
  - **Box 3 → Border only**  
  - **Box 4 → Full box model (margin + padding + border)**  
- Styled with different **colors, spacing, and border styles** to clearly see differences.

## 🎯 Learnings  
- **Margin** affects space *outside* the element.  
- **Padding** increases space *inside* around the content.  
- **Border** visually separates the content/padding from the outside.  
- Together, these build the **CSS box model**, which controls layout.
